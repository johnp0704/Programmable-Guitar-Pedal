Final Project

## Overview
This project creates a guitar pedal using an Arduino UNO that can be programmed to give effects, such as delay, distortion, loop, etc. This project uses an Arduino UNO, a two-stage Op-Amp circuit to modify the signal from the guitar and to the amp, and
an ADC and DAC. This project posed significant challenges, as the output was unable to match the frequency of the input, causing significant unwanted distortion in the output.
